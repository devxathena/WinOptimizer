- **Asynchronous Downloads**: Utilizes `aiohttp` for concurrent downloading, significantly reducing overall wait time compared to synchronous methods.
- **Latest Release Retrieval**: Automatically fetches the latest release of each specified GitHub repository, utilizing the GitHub API for efficiency.
- **Branch Fallback**: If no release is available, the tool automatically defaults to downloading the primary branch, ensuring that users can still access the latest code.
- **Sysinternals Suite Download**: Seamlessly integrates with the Sysinternals Suite, downloading the latest version to provide essential Windows utilities.
- **Rich Console Output**: Employs the `rich` library for visually appealing and informative logging, enhancing the user experience during operations.
- **Organized File Structure**: Downloads are organized into clearly defined directories, simplifying file management for users.


## Installation
